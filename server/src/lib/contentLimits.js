// These limits exist for one reason: without them, a very long paste into
// any field could overflow cards, break the grid layout, or blow up the
// page. They're enforced in two places that must be kept in sync:
//   - here, on the server, as the real enforcement (nothing bypasses this)
//   - client/lib/contentLimits.js, for maxLength attributes + counters in
//     the admin editor, so the UI stops you before you'd hit a server error
